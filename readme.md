2.10.8 % of our dataset user types are Customers, while the remaining 89.2% are Subscribers 
3.The majority of the ford gobike users are Males, followed by Females then others
4.The Ford gobike members that are born on 1988 are the most frequent users

## Key Insights for Presentation
> The observations we noticed in the multivariant exploration idicates very critical insights. We notice that the decision made to pick the most popular 50 bikes are influenced by the gender other and user_type customer. Both of these attributes represents the minor population in our dataset. So any business decisions to boost the sales/manufacture of these bikes will likely be incorrect, since they do not represent the majority of our dataset ( male and subscriber users). However if the business plan is to increase the gobike awareness and attract new customers, those bikes would definitely help.
